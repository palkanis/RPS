Rock Papers Scissors Project

This project was a great practice for fundamenals of JS. I created different functions using conditional statements and comparison operators and also used a while loop to iterate over a function a few times. 

I was able to use the problem-solving tips given in the reading to good use by implementing them whenever I felt stuck, breaking down the problem into smaller chunks and solving one small problem at a time. 

I still got stuck at not being able to create an effective way to recall the functions after an initial call and would surely come back to fix it soon. For now, I just resorted to calling the functions by name in the while loop instead of assigning a variable to the function call.
